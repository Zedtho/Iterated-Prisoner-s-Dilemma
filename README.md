# Simulation-Reciprocal-Altruism
Game Theoretic Simulation of the iterated Prisoner's dilemma

This program is supposed to be a simulation to test certain game-theoretic approaches to the evolution of reciprocal altruism.

The different branches have different functionalities:
Master contains the most strategies that can be tinkered with and is the most general.
Invasion is tailor-made for an investigation on the invasion of the Tit-for-tat strategy of a native All-D.
